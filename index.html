      <h2>Introduction to Climate Change</h2>
      <p>Climate change is a dramatic or subtle general change in climate due to humans, sudden changes in the environment, or on its own.</p>
      <p>Most climate change happens when too many gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are in the atmosphere. (These gases are called 'greenhouse gases'.) These gases are called greenhouse gases because they act like a greenhouse on Earth's surface: they trap heat from the Sun and keep it on our planet, unintentionally making it warmer.</p>
      <p>A normal Earth atmosphere would have sucked in a fraction of the Sun's heat, then let the rest 'evaporate' into the vacuum of space. Sadly, greenhouse gases are increasing the rate that the Earth absorbs the Sun's heat, making the Earth hotter.</p>
      <p>For example, we are in a 'warm' ice age. However, several millennia ago, we were in a <i>very</i> cold ice age. However, starting from a few million years ago, the Earth has warmed up on its own.</p>
      <p>However, humans have had a <b>HUGE</b> impact on our environment and the Earth's climate.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Humanity's impact on the Environment</h2>
      <p>Almost all humans produce some kind of waste that helps climate change grow.</p>
