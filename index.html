      <h2>Introduction to Climate Change</h2>
      <p>Climate change is a dramatic or subtle general change in climate due to humans, sudden changes in the environment, or on its own.</p>
      <p>For example, we are in a 'warm' ice age. However, several millennia ago, we were in a <i>very</i> cold ice age. However, starting from a few million years ago, the Earth has warmed up on its own.</p>
      <p>However, humans have had a <b>HUGE</b> impact on our environment and the Earth's climate.</p>
